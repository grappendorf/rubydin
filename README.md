= Rubydin

_Note: This project is currently no longer developed. I abandoned Java programming altogether and now solely use
Ruby/Rails/CoffeeScript/AngularJS and similar tools. The latest Rubydin version uses Vaadin 6.8.6. Feel free to fork
this project if you want to extend on it._

Write Vaadin applications in the Ruby programming language.
